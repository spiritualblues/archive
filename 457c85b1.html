  <div>My son's cheap overweight 17-inch Acer Chromebook is my favorite secondary computer. I pretty much live in my browser for my personal computing needs. <br><br>Unfortunately there aren't too many premium 17 inch chromebooks. Your best bet would be to get a premium 17 inch HP with windows and just stick to the chrome browser for your needs while ignoring the OS. </div>
