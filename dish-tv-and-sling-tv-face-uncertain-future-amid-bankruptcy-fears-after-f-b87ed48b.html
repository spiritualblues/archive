  <div> Dish TV was the first one to start a cable streaming service, Sling and the first one to dare to unbundle, an unchartered territory back then.</div><div>

</div><div><br></div><div>Their goal back them was to completely pivot streaming and be able to give up satellite TV once Sling matures. But they could never put their first mover advantage to good use. Their app has been sluggish and falters a lot.</div><div><br></div><div>

</div><div><br></div><div><br></div><div>Somehow DirecTV came late to the streaming party and yet managed to do exactly that.

</div><pre>The future of DISH TV and Sling TV hangs in the balance. Without the DirecTV merger, DISH must find new ways to stabilize its pay-TV operations. Sling TV, one of the more affordable live TV streaming services, remains a bright spot, with its $45-per-month Blue plan offering local channels in select markets. Yet, it faces fierce competition from YouTube TV, Hulu + Live TV, and DirecTV’s new genre-based streaming bundles. DISH’s satellite TV service, meanwhile, appears increasingly unsustainable as cord-cutting accelerates.</pre>
