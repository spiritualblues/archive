        <h1>Show all events for a day in month view</h1>
  
  <div>Zoho calendar 📆is the only calendar on earth 🌐 that lets you view all entries under every day in the month view without collapsing or hiding entries beyond 5 and requiring you to click ‘more’ to view them all. <br><br>This bird 🐧eye view is very useful to be able to browse through the whole month. And at the same time be able to see everything that is planned for a day that we are focussed on. I dont know 🤷‍♂️why this isn't a big deal for all but it is for me. <br><br>You have to select ‘show all events within date’. Your calendar height would keep on auto expanding to add rows for the week where you have more entries, making the calendar have a vertical scroll bar for the month if needed. Unfortunately this only works in their web view and not on their mobile apps. <br><br><figure>

</figure><br><br>Hey calendar does that for their week view, but so do a lot of calendars. Which doesn’t solve the problem for me. They don't have a month view at all. Their philosophy is that we think in terms of weeks and not the whole month. This is untrue, at least for me. </div>
