  <div>I keep thinking about this one evening before Christmas - <br><br>My son decided to keep a broken ornament for our tree 🌲. I did not notice that the snowman ornament I bought had a missing arm until we checked out of the store. He felt bad for the snowman and decided not to exchange him (we were still in the parking lot) since NO ONE ELSE WOULD BUY HIM. 😢</div>
