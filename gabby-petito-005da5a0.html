<br>This documentary is terrifying. The cops in Moab, Utah obviously noticed her being slapped over her face. But are preoccupied with the scratch marks on Brians's face. And concluded that he is the victim. They ( including a female cop) just can't see her as the victim who was obviously showing signs of dependence on her abuser. He gets a hotel room for the night but she is asked to stay overnight in her van alone. </div>
