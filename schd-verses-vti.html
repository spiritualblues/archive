<br>Many SCHD supporters firmly believe it is the best choice as the foundation of their portfolio. <br><br>However, I disagree. VTI offers the same sense of security and is likely to outperform SCHD in the future. With SCHD, you risk underperformance while also paying higher fees, even though VTI provides a similar level of security.<br><br>Overall, VTI is safer than most high-flying tech and small-cap stocks. <br><br><figure>
