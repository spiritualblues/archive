</div><blockquote>The anthropologist David Graeber called <br>these "bullshit jobs"—roles that even the<br> people doing them suspect are pointless.<br> But I think it's evolved beyond that. <br>We've built entire ecosystems of mutual <br>nonsense.</blockquote><div>
<br>Here are <a href="https://thestillwandering.substack.com/p/the-death-of-the-corporate-job-part">parts 2</a><a href="https://thestillwandering.substack.com/p/the-death-of-the-corporate-worker">and 3</a> of his post. <br><br>I don't feel their jobs are 100 percent hollow. And they are not completely worthless. I am sure they are contributing more at their workplace than they think. This is not a yes no question. <br><br>As you get comfortable in your role, you feel everything is on autopilot. You are still taking decisions that are more like guardrails than major pivots. Your team members are doing what they are supposed to do. That's because you are right by them nodding your approval. In your prolonged absence things would gradually start drifting off course. And the point is that they would not realize that is happening. Or would not care with the same degree of ownership. This drift is costly for your corporate. And that is where your work is worth more than you think. </div><ul>
<li>What you can start doing is calling out unnecessary steps in decision-making. </li>
<li>And credit your team when and where credit is due. </li>
<li>Everytime you add an extra task for them, take something off their plate. </li>
<li>When they are understaffed, roll up your sleeves and get in the trenches and work alongside them. </li>
<li>If someone needs time off and can't since no one is available to cross-cover her, you can do the task yourself and let her have that day off she was really hoping to have. </li>
