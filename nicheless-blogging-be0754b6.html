        <h1>Nicheless blogging</h1>
  
  <div>I'm contemplating whether I should create multiple distinct blogs to focus on various topics or keep a single, broad blog that covers everything. On one hand, I could dedicate individual blogs to discussing music and TV shows, money management and investing, healthcare policy, and even a space for random posts I’d classify as miscellaneous. Additionally, I could have a blog centered around the trends in streaming services and cable TV unbundling, as well as chronicle my journey with a personal health issue.<br><br>However, the alternative approach would involve maintaining one blog that's nicheless and more varied. This would allow me to update it more frequently. While the first option might help in growing an audience—encouraging readers to return for more content and potentially sign up for a mailing list—the second option could lead to more regular updates and better search rankings. Yet, it’s uncertain if the diverse content would translate into dedicated followers who regularly engage with the blog. It’s a tricky decision!</div>
