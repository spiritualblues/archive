        <h1>That one Thai place.</h1>
  
  <div>We have a special place in our hearts for humble restaurants that serve delicious food in old, worn-down buildings located in less trendy areas. These places don’t try too hard to impress you with fancy silverware, upscale interiors, or curated online ratings.<br><br>The locals appreciate them; they know the value of a pure, superior product—the taste of the food. That’s what everyone comes there for.<br><br><figure>
