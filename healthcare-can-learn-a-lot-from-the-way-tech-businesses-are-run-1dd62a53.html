Healthcare has a lot to learn from tech (virtual care like teladoc).<br><br>Tech companies are very explicit and detailed oriented when onboarding you. Hospitals just give you a start date. Go figure. <br>Credentialing 📝 and board licensing 🪪 takes upto 4 months. You gotta wait until the next quarter 📋 when the appropriate committee meets again 🤷‍♂️. Virtual 💻 clinics verify your identity and complete your credentialing in less than a week. <br>Don’t keep patients holding to talk to their nurse and other staff. Leverage the power of asynchronous 📧 communication. Let them book their own appointments. Let the doc quickly click book their next appointment 📆 before the visit is done.</div>
