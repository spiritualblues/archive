        <h1>What’s your toxic red flag? </h1>
  
  <div>I often craft a sneaky little game out of replying to those missed unread messages after chatting with the person on the phone. Imagine this: I respond in a way that makes it seem like our phone conversation never even touched on that topic! After all, they might not have seen my reply before our call. But that time stamp? It’s a little devil that gives me away! Maybe it was just a bad network connection, delaying my message until after we hung up.</div>
