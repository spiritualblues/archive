        <h1>CNBC + </h1>
  
  <div>CNBC has quietly launched a standaline streaming service for $15 per month. This includes their live CNBC stream and on demand library of daily episodes. <br><br>Until now the cheapest way to get this channel was buying sling blue plus the news add-on which sets you back by 51$ per month. Which is a steep price if all you watch is CNBC. So this is a peculiar choice for a niche audience that want CNBC without all the sports and other news channels bundled in. <br><br>Comcast plans to spin away MSNBC, CNBC and USA. I am curious to see who keeps the rights for EPL. I bet they would stay with peacock. </div>
