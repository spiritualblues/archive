  <div>Since Chrome started gaining popularity around 2010, I had never looked back at Firefox. I have to maintain two separate Chrome profiles—one for work and one for personal use. Right-clicking and switching back and forth between them requires a lot of clicks for me. Although I know I can keep both open side by side, that distracts me; plus, the two Chrome windows look so similar that I really have to think hard to distinguish between them. <br><br>So, I decided to switch to Firefox for my personal profile, and it has not disappointed. I love the customization options, and I appreciate being able to keep an AI chat tab open on the left side of my screen all the time. It makes great use of my two ultrawide monitors' real estate.</div>
