  <div>If he can fall for this, countless uninformed voters around the world could also be misled in the moments before crucial elections. </div><div><br></div><div>Or perhaps he's playing dumb 😉 effectively demonstrating a business case on how his company’s tool can be leveraged (or read abused).

<br>What if this by itself is fake news? <br><br>Seems like Forbes and others picked it up so there may be some credibility to it. Never heard of 404 media before. <br><br>
</div><pre>According to <a href="https://www.404media.co/viral-challah-horse-zuckerberg-loved-was-created-as-a-warning-about-facebooks-ai-slop">404 Media</a>, the Challah Horse originated from a Polish news outlet called Donald.pl, which satirized Facebook’s flood of AI-generated slop by posting the image with the caption, “This woman baked a challah horse but no one congratulated her.”The ironic post was inevitably reposted in earnest by spam accounts on Facebook, and the <a href="https://www.facebook.com/share/p/18GfxpqEGn/">Challah Horse post</a> that Zuckerberg “loved” came from Faithful, a verified page with 1.1 million followers.</pre>
