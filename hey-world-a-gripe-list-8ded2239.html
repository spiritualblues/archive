        <h1>Hey World - a gripe list</h1>
  
  <div>I love posting on Hey World but here is my gripe - </div><ul>
<li>I can’t change the post title. I am sure this has something to do with the post permalink. But nothing that cannot be tweaked by them. </li>
<li>I can’t change the name of the blog to anything other than my full name. I am sure Hey does not want to be a full fledged product for blogging. And they would not change this. I think they want to avoid their service to be abused for spam. </li>
<li>I wish I had a way to add categories or tags to the posts. </li>
<li>No custom domain. I am not holding my breath. I am confident about their longevity that a lot of other blogging platforms. </li>
<li>Click on an image and it has to somehow downloaded to you device. You can’t just open it in the browser or a new window. Feels clunky to the end user. </li>
</ul>
