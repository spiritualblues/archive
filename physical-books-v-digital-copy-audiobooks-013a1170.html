        <h1>Physical books v. digital copy / audiobooks.</h1>
  
  <div>Some argue that reading a physical book is better than an e-reader 💻or an audiobook 🎧. I disagree. You are leveraging technology, and now you have the following advantages : <br><br>
</div><ul><li>Let's say you are traveling ✈️. You can not carry hundreds of books in your carry-on. Mid-flight, you change your mind and now want to switch gears to something light and put down your serious heavy read. You can't do that with a physical book. </li></ul><div><br></div><ul><li>I don't have the time 👔💼 or energy to read at this moment, but I can listen to an audiobook on my way to work. That way, I would cover more books in a year than with physical books. It's that inertia🫸 that one needs to get past. </li></ul><div><br></div><ul>
<li>🤷‍♂️ I don't care about ownership of a copy. In this day and age of abundance, I would not return to a book 📚 again once completed. </li>
<li><br></li>
<li>The clutter of physical goods around me makes me restless. </li>
</ul><div>
