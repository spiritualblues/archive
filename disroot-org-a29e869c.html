  <div>Consider <a href="https://disroot.org/en/blog/disnews-24.12">supporting disroot</a> so that overseas activists with weaker purchasing power parity who use their service get to keep using them. I am sure there are a lot of users in other countries who genuinely cannot pay for this. <br><br>Unlike big tech disroot does not have deep pockets to sustain their free userbase. Their tech is not superior compared to Protonmail - basically they are promising not to look at your data but technically they can. But I think Proton has enough traction to keep growing. Good for them. We need to help the smaller players. Disroot is transparent about its expenses / spending and current donation amounts. Which I always admire as a supporter.<br><br><br>
</div><pre><em>What happens when your hobby project becomes essential to thousands of people? It's no longer just a hobby. This year, we've realized Disroot is at a turning point. The project has grown beyond what we can maintain in our free time with duct tape and determination alone.</em></pre><div><br></div><pre><em>That's why we've started financially compensating muppeth with €1,000 per month, with the goal of increasing this gradually — through your donations — until we can pay full-time work on Disroot. This is a critical step to securing the project's future.</em></pre><div><br></div><pre><em>But here's the challenge: we're falling short of this year's financial target. Even worse, we're unable to support the open-source projects we rely on as much as we used to. While donations have increased since 2020, the number of supporters has stayed the same. To all of you loyal contributors, thank you — you've kept us going! 🙏</em></pre><div><br></div><pre><em>However, we need more people to join. Small contributions make a big difference when more people chip in! If you value the services we provide and haven't started supporting yet, now is the time to act. Together, we can sustain a real alternative to big tech services </em></pre><div>
