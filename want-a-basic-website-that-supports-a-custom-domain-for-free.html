        <h1>Want a basic website that supports a custom domain for free?</h1>
  
  <div><em>Are you looking to create your own free website with support for a custom domain without needing to pay at all, except for the domain name? But at the same time, you wish to see the service minimize its own branding or ads. If you look around, even the most basic web hosting plans seem to start at $5 per month. Even a linktr.ee starter page costs $5 per month. But what if you do not need a full-fledged website, but just a low-key 'no frills' digital place to call home and feel even the $5 per month is too much? </em></div><div><br></div><div>
<a href="https://sites.google.com/">Google sites</a> seems to be still around although their theme options are dated. If your domain name is purchased through google domains, pointing your domain to this service is a seamless process. </div><div><br></div><div>If you are looking to run a blog, I would recommend <a href="https://www.medium.com/">medium.com</a>. Medium charges $5 per month for a membership which lets you read all articles on their service. If you are a member you may set up a custom domain for your blog. Once your domain is set, if you chose to discontinue your membership (wink, wink), I am hearing that you can keep your domain pointing to your blog. Medium has an active community and you likely would generate good traffic to your page. You would not be able to customize your blog page much apart from the background color, fonts, and a header image or text. The layout of your page is non-customizable though. Note that Medium does suggest related articles from other users at the bottom of your article or in your right sidebar. They also force readers to sign up / login before they can read articles which can be annoying to your readers experience. </div><div><br></div><div>Yes, <a href="https://www.blogger.com/">Blogger</a> still exists too, and lets you use custom domain pointing for one or more domain names. If Medium does not click well for you, this could be your choice.</div><div><br></div><div>If you are looking for a linktr.ee like service that supports custom domain for free, try the lesser-known  <a href="https://www.drum.io/"><del>drum.io</del></a> (shut down). This service makes most of its revenue through commission from e-commerce sales from your page if you chose to sell through them in the future.</div><div><br></div><div>
<a href="https://www.read.cv/"><del>Read.cv</del></a> (now a paid feature) is a Linkedin like social network and you can point your custom domain to your profile page which is essentially your CV and list of accomplishments. This service would be ideal if you desire to point your domain to showcase your work portfolio. There is a catch though - you need to get 5 of your friends to sign up before you can unlock the custom domain feature. I love their clean interface.</div><div><br></div><div>
<a href="https://www.ucraft.com/">Ucraft</a> is an e-commerce platform that supports custom domains for your shop.</div><div><br></div><div>
<a href="https://www.getrevue.co/"><del>Revue</del></a> (shut down) is more of an email newsletter service. I do not care for their interface. This service integrates well into your Twitter profile so it may be your service of choice from this list if you are an active Twitter user. </div><div>
<br><a href="https://slashpage.com/slashpage-customdomain2?lang=en">Slashpage</a> lets you add a custom domain on its free tier, as long as you have a complete website and not just a under construction page. <br><br><a href="https://hashnode.com/">Hashnode</a> has a free tier for a personal blog. <br><br><a href="http://www.pagy.co/">Pagy.co</a> lets you build a single-page website and connect a custom domain. <br><br><br>
</div><div><strong><em>A few other services listed below are almost free. </em></strong></div><div><br></div><div>
<a href="https://www.name.com/website-builder">Name.com</a> lets you build a single-page website for $5 per year. </div><div><br></div><div>
<a href="https://www.bio.link/">Bio.link</a>  is a linkr.ee like service that charges <del>30 per year</del> (now expensive than that) for custom domain support. Other similar services include - tapbiolink.com and Lnk.bio. All of these seem to be in their infancy, so be warned, they may suddenly shut down someday.</div><div><br></div><div>
<a href="https://www.substack.com/">Substack</a> is a newsletter service that lets you add a custom domain for your newsletter homepage for a one-time fee($50 currently).</div><div><br></div><div>
<a href="https://www.carrd.co/">Carrd.co</a> lets you create a landing page or a portfolio page for a low annual fee($19 per year and up). I love their themes including the ones that are even available with the free plan. They have run a steep discount for Black Fridays in the past. <br><br><a href="https://montaigne.io/pricing">montaigne.io</a> and <a href="https://docs.alto.so/">alto.so</a> lets you connect your domain for $2 per month. You can have unlimited number of blogs or static websites for that price. </div><div>
<br>If you are ok with the headache of hosting (support hiccups, language barrier, a little more than acceptable downtime here and there) in a developing world you can get WordPress hosting for 1 to 5 $ per month for one to an unlimited number of wordpress sites. <br><br>
</div><div><em>Not showing ads or their own branding would mean they are providing this service as a loss leader. This list may help you get your feet wet and if you like one of them you may want to consider upgrading in the future to support them.</em></div>
