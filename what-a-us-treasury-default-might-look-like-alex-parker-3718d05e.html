</div><div><br></div><div>Some <em>dystopian</em> light reading before you go to bed. <br><br>The crypto <em>fan boys</em> can skip to the good part.</div><pre>So if the financial system implodes, who’s paying the miners? Who’s covering the energy costs? Who’s maintaining the hardware?

And that leads to an even stranger set of problems. Let’s say miners start shutting down because they can’t afford energy, bandwidth, or cloud computing resources. With fewer and fewer miners competing to validate transactions, the network becomes slower and more fragile. If enough miners drop out, what happens to Bitcoin itself?

Would the blockchain survive? If too many miners go offline, could the remaining nodes fall out of sync, fracturing Bitcoin into competing, corrupted ledgers? And if that happens, in a system with no central authority, who gets to decide which version is the right one?

If Trump defaults on Treasuries, Bitcoin (all crypto) doesn’t become a refuge—it becomes collateral damage</pre>
