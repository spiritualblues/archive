        <h1>ESPN’s dilemma</h1>
  
  <h1><strong>We don't want to unbundle, but if it does happen, we need to stay ahead of the curve.</strong></h1><div>
<br>Disney is simulcasting more MNF games than ever before on ABC and ESPN+. The company that has the most to lose from cable TV bundles breaking down is doing the same to the cable companies that historically have colluded with Disney.  Over the next 5 years I believe they will move everything to ESPN +. They get to keep all the profits from their own DTC offering this way. Rather than sharing with the cable companies. They are trying to stay ahead of the game and moving fast. To heck with bundling. They don't mind phasing out bundling that they themselves created. <br><br>If MNF is no longer exclusive to ESPN, the only major events that stay exclusive are regular-season NBA games and the college football championship. <br><br>CBS and NBC have already gone rouge and have their local broadcast channel including their NFL games offered through their stand-alone apps. I am baffled why fox is staying out of the standalone DTC landscape. Are they seeing something that others aren't? Or are they going to regret eventually? <br><br><figure>
