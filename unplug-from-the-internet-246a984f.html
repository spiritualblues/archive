        <h1>Unplug from the internet</h1>
  
  <div> Do you all ever take a break from your constantly connected online life? Sometimes I leave my devices in another room and spend time reading a paper book or on my Kindle, which I keep offline. Sometimes, I go for walks without my phone, although I might wear a smartwatch just in case I need to call someone or for family to reach me. I'm also thinking about setting up a regular alarm clock by my bedside and keeping my phone a bit further away. It feels pretty strange not being reachable when I'm outside, especially with young kids, but honestly, people have raised kids for ages without being so plugged in.<br><br><figure>
