        <h1>Amazon music (is probably struggling to retain subscribers)</h1>
  
  <div>Amazon Music's ($10 plan and up) unlimited plan now includes an audible title a month. This may sound like a steal, but I do not think you own the title forever like you do through a traditional $15$ Audible membership. This might still be okay for someone like me who would listen to a book, but I doubt if I will ever listen to the title again in the future. <br><br>My wife and kids use my individual YouTube plan a lot, either for YT music or ad-free YouTube. So the above subscription makes sense to me so that they don’t keep getting the more-than-one-stream restriction that YouTube is starting to enforce more and more nowadays. <br><br> I just have a lot of ‘unread’ audible titles that I should get through first. On further probing, I see a single-device Amazon music plan without the audible option for $6, which might make better sense for me than the $10 plan. <br><br><figure>
