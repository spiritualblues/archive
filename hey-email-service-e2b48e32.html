        <h1>Hey email service</h1>
  
  <div>The whole hey way of their ecosystem is growing on me as I keep renewing my annual subscription. <br><br>I can't live without their screener, especially considering you can screen out entire domains. <br><br>And now that I can send via Gmail too, it make sense to use this service more like an email client until you are sure about it. That way you get gmails accurate spam filtering too. Come on you know what I mean - no spam filters come close to Google’s.  I just wish hey had an option to disable their own spam filters especially since they have their own “screen out” filter anyways. May be these two folders can be combined. <br><br>I let messages get stuck in the screener for a while and bulk screen out entire apammy domains periodically. I have to eyeball the screener every now and then to make sure I did not miss anything time sensitive. <br><br>The ‘let it flow’ philosophy is so much better than inbox zero. I still wish they would let us import in old email and had better search to go through past email. <br><br>The Captain Planet inside me likes that I can auto delete those 1000s of notification emails after 2 years. <br><br>Email that I never need to really see goes into papertrail. This could be for all your emails that you can look at the header and say - yes I dont need to open this email. The next time you visit, you will see a blue wavy line separating email that you glanced through the last time so you know all that is new that needs glancing this time. <br><br>All your newsletters that you would want to read but never actually do goes to the feed. Basically this folder is like a social media feed where in all your emails are partially open. Theses are emails you don't care if you don't read. But need to peek through and decide the ones needing to be read completely.</div>
