It’s completely normal to move back and forth between them, and the intensity of feelings can sometimes be surprising. Give them the space they need to process information at their own pace. Let them know you are there to support them whenever they need it. It’s okay to embrace silence; you don’t have to fill every moment with words. Try to maintain eye contact, even if they don’t seem comfortable doing so. Allow them the freedom to look away or down if that’s what they need. Your presence can provide comfort, even in quiet moments.</div>
