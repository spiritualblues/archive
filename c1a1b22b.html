  <div>The Pacers were on the edge of their seats the entire game last night, fighting hard but trailing the whole way. Just when it seemed like all hope was lost, they closed in with a thrilling score of 109-110! Then, in a heart-stopping moment, Haliburton, the incredible playmaker, swooped in and sank a jaw-dropping shot with just three-tenths of a second left on the clock! Boom! The crowd erupted as the scoreboard flashed 111-110! What an unforgettable finish!</div><div><br></div><div>
