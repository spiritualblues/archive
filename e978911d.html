        <h1>Time for change</h1>
  
  <div>
<em>This journal entry was written 📝 on Aug 21 2025. So all that is here is in past tense. </em><br><br>I am considering a transition from my current job to a new position that is radically different. This change is motivated partly by health reasons and partly by personal considerations. <br><br>I have three options in front of me, each distinct from my current role and from one another. When I think about how I might grow in this new role over the next three years, the differences become even more pronounced.<br><br>
</div><div>The first option is a 100 percent remote position, and I would be giving up on my broad skills and focusing on just one aspect of my work. That is a scary proposition. When I grow out of this role, I am unsure if future opportunities involving a promotion would be available as remote. It is doubtful we would be ever be willing to relocate.<br><br>
</div><div>The second job will require a lot of traveling from site to site, and professionally, it will require me to be a complete extrovert. Which I am not in my personal life. But based on past experience, I can wing it. No, really, it's not out of my grasp. This is one of those high-risk, high-reward opportunities that do not come often. What I would be supervising is what I have done most of my life. If you have lived that experience in person, you are in a better position to lead. It's one of those situations.<br><br>
</div><div>The final option is with my current employer at a new site over an hour away, which involves significant travel. I'm hoping the travel will be balanced by a lighter workload. This role will require me to shift to a different work profile, but I see great potential for advancement if I put in the effort. I'm excited about the opportunity to grow at this new location.<br><br>
