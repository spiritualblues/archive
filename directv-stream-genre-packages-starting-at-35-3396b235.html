        <h1>DIRECTV Stream Genre packages starting at $35</h1>
  
  <div> Direct TV has launched cheaper “genre packages” thus lowering the pricing for base packages for cable. </div><div><br></div><div>The “entertainment package” for 35 per month excludes all broadcast and sports channels. I think getting Disney and Fox not to force bundle their sports rights was their biggest barrier.  Also now the deal is done this package will hopefully be immune to price increases. You get ad supported basic Hulu, Disney+ and soon ad supported basic Max. </div><div><br></div><div>A $40 “my news” package includes locals (not all in all locations) except CBS. Basically this will be your NFL only package but will exclude MNF and TNF. </div><div>

</div><div><br></div><div>Their “my sports” pack includes ESPN+ and is priced at 70. You can add NFL red zone as an upgrade. I <a href="https://spi.blue/skinny-sports-bundles-754ee29b">wrote about this package</a> a few days ago. I see ABC is missing but usually those games are simulcasted on ESPN+. CBS may be coming. If not, you can get your CBS stream through paramount plus. Honestly you are not saving much here unless of they throw in regional sports networks etc. You might as well get their standard signature cable packages. <br><br>DirectTV stream has unlimited DVR, unlimited streams, excellent stream quality and a reputation for minimal hiccoughs. I would rate them a close second to Youtube TV. Sling TV in contrast has been unreliable, charge extra for DVR and has a single ESPN stream in their sling orange package. </div>
