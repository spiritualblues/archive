        <h1>Teachers 🧑‍🏫 </h1>
  
  <div>The importance of teaching is highly underappreciated and that makes me sad. Of course I feel sad for the teachers, but more for our next generation. If we don't value the profession, the brightest won’t choose teaching as their career path. <br><br>With vast amounts of knowledge being accesible for everyone, I feel a teachers most important job now is to INSPIRE us into self propelled learning. And keep us engaged there on a continuing basis. </div>
