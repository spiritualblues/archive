</div><div><br></div><div>I just have never understood the point of listening to a live sports event in this day and age. The purists swear by it. But either you could watch it or you couldn't.  Why listen to the whole thing live? Catch up the key plays or highlights later. Or watch a recorded version later. <br><br>Sirius XM keeps adverising their live sports 🏈 coverage a lot. </div>
