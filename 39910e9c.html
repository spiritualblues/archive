</div><div>This seems to an all time low point in the curtailment of 🗽 freedom of expression in US. And, this shit is terrifying now. Compared to the rest of the world this country has always been much more accepting of viewpoints you do not agree with.  </div><div><br></div><div>He is a late night host who discusses current issues. He got canned for discussing a current issue. Not a word of what he said was remotely inappropriate. It just wasn’t what the current administration wanted to here. They strong-armed Disney into pulling the plug on his show. Conservative Nexstar affiliates declined to air his episode. Disney bowed out. Shame on you. Of all the bullshit stands you have taken in the past for so called woke causes this was one time you had to truly stand up and not give in. </div>
