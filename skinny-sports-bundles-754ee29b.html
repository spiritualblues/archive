</div><div><br></div><div>Direct tv is feeling the pressure of unbundling and soft launched a not so cheap sports-centric offering. </div><div><br></div><div>For those who claim cable unbundling is never going to happen - and all we will get are streaming bundles instead of cable bundles - your patience has been rewarded.  But there isn't going to be value in these packages. They have to passon marketing, other fixed costs and account servicing cost to you. Plus account for the churn and the cost of the fact that users are not going to stay subscribed after their favourite followed sports season is over. </div><div><br></div><div>Venu had a sad demise. But you still can just subscribe to CBS and NBC through Paramount plus and Peacock. Disney will launch a sports-specific bundle later this year which will include ESPN/ABC. FOX will soon launch a FOX / fox news service.  TNT/TBS are available through MAX. </div><div><br></div><div>UEFA and EPL are available through Paramount and Peacock. ESPN is simulcasting their events on ABC or ESPN+ either for maximizing their ad revenue, to bring enough value to their streaming service or to appease the leagues. </div><div><br></div><div>I think this is as good as it gets for you, sports fans. </div>
