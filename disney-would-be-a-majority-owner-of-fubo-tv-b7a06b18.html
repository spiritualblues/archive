        <h1>Disney would be a majority owner of Fubo TV</h1>
  
  <div> This is so crazy. Fubo TV cried foul that a <a href="https://espnpressroom.com/us/press-releases/2025/01/venu-sports-will-be-discontinued/amp/">sports only ESPN/FOX/TNT</a> offering would undermine their big fat cable bundle. Courts <a href="https://www.sportspro.com/news/venu-sports-fubo-injunction-launch-delay-disney-fox-wbd/">agreed</a> that this is anti competitive. </div><div><br></div><div>So as a part of the settlement Disney <a href="https://frontofficesports.com/disney-buys-fubo-killing-venu-lawsuit/">agreed to buy a majority stake</a> in Fubo TV and would merge Hulu Live with them. Any they will move ahead with a standalone ESPN offering later this year presumably launched through Fubo TV. Hulu Live would cease to exist. But I am sure there will be a Disney + / ESPN + / Fubo standalone ESPN sports bundle. I bet this bundle will skip TNT since they are losing NBA. </div><div>

</div><div><br></div><div>How is this not going to be anti competitive to Direct TV, Dish or Spectrum ? </div><div><br></div><div>I am thinking Google and Amazon would be Disney’s future competition for sports broadcasting. Google’s YouTube TV is fairly successful. Amazon has TNF, will have a lot of NBA and possibly NBA league pass. </div><div><br></div><div>CBS and NBC are being ignored by them as they already have their independent offerings. They have enough NFL to keep existing. NBC will carry a fair degree of NBA in the near future. <br><br><br>
</div><div>FOX is the only major player that will not have their own standalone offering. </div>
