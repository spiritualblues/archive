        <h1>Black Friday deals</h1>
  
  <div>It's t<em>hat time of the year when you are excited about  a 50 percent discount on stuff that you </em><strong><em>100 percent don’t need</em></strong><em>. <br></em><br>
</div><div>I am tempted to buy <a href="http://remarkable.com">Remarkable</a>, although I hardly ever take handwritten notes. I have a good use case for reading books, for which I already have a Kindle. Reddit says Kindle Scribe is even better. I am already in their walled garden ecosystem, so that rules out Remarkable for me. <br><br>Streaming subscriptions are often heavily discounted, though. For $60, I got a year’s worth of NBA league pass. I may buy Hulu for a year and/or Max for 6 months.  <br><br>And I am wondering if I should buy a lifetime proton pass subscription primarily to support their cause and stand on privacy. <br><br>Mxroute has a $75$ lifetime plan for unlimited domains and email addresses (limited to 5 GB and 300 emails per hour )—which is a steal, but again, there is a 90 percent chance I don't need it. I am happy with HEYemail, and for the sake of simplicity, I don't want multiple email addresses for each domain. <br><br><figure>
