It might even be cheaper, and you can do much more with iOS. All the features they talk about (chore lists for kids) are achievable through various calendar and to-do apps. <br><br>Wait, there is also an unnecessary monthly 'plus' subscription. You can reward your kids with gold stars. </div><pre>Keep tabs on progress with a tap! Add stars to Chores to motivate kids to complete tasks by earning Rewards.</pre><div>
