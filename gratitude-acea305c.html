  <div>Our new nanny is truly a game-changer! Our daughter even wrote her name on her Thanksgiving gratitude card. It’s amazing! If she had asked us who she should mention, we would have instantly said, “Definitely our fabulous nanny!” Seeing our daughter appreciate her in such a unique way feels so wonderful!<br><br><figure>
