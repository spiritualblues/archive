        <h1>Exploring Micro.blog</h1>
  
  <div>I am starting to tinker with <a href="http://micro.blog">Micro.blog</a>. I do not want to be on social media, but I also don't want to feel like I am speaking to an empty room. <br><br>
</div><div>I  🤔 think the audience at Micro.blog feels more grown up. They are all <a href="https://micro.blog/about/pricing">paid</a> non-bot humans, and I see no self-promotion or sponsored posts. There is no toxic negativity of 🐦X, <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/LinkedInLunatics/comments/1eet5hh/the_cult_of_toxic_positivity/">toxic positivity</a> of 👔 LinkedIn, dragged-out verbal diarrhea like posts on Medium, or perennially upset crowd like on 🦋 Bluesky. Thus, overall, Micro.blog is a good social community. Their iOS app is stellar. <br><br>
</div><div>But I will still waste a lot of time there. I would rather read posts on <a href="http://read.write.as">read.write.as</a>, Bear Blog’s <a href="https://bearblog.dev/discover/">Discover</a> page, Blot.im’s <a href="https://blot.im/examples">example sites</a>, or smol.pub’s <a href="https://smol.pub/feed">feed</a>. These are more thought-out and well-written entries. <br><br>
</div><div>Maybe I will keep writing on Pagecord but cross-post a few articles there. I love the posting by email along with link previews rendered by the iOS mail app I use for posting to pagecord. I like the continuous scroll nature rather than multiple pages. I also like being able to see the whole post rather than needing to expand the partial preview or have a list of titles as the only option. <br><br>
</div><div>Micro.blog lets us pull our RSS feed from external sources. The blog versus timeline is a bit confusing. Everything from your <a href="https://micro.blog/about/blogging">Micro.blog</a> goes to the <a href="https://micro.one/about/blogging">timeline</a>, but everything entered on the timeline does not go to your Micro.blog. Everything posted on your timeline can be cross-posted to an externally compatible blog. The timeline was an afterthought. <br><br>
</div><div>I will start by replying and interacting with peeps there to see how it goes. </div>
