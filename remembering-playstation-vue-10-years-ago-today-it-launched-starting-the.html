  <div>PS Vue was the first service to offer unlimited cloud DVR. Adding a program to the DVR just automatically meant that the episode was instantly available  in your library. They saved a copy of everything on linear tv in the cloud and gave you instant access to a copy of your show. This is a significant upgrade from the limited amount of recording on your hard disc DVR device which used to be slow and clunky. Episodes would however auto delete in a month. This was a watershed moment for cloud DVR. YouTube TV, Hulu Live and Directv Stream’s predecessor soon were pressured into following suit to offer unlimited cloud based DVR. I sorely miss PS Vue. </div><div><br></div><div>
