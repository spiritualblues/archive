  <div>Found this great read - <br> <br><a href="https://tanmay.bearblog.dev/perfection/">Imperfect Perfection</a><br><a href="https://tanmay.bearblog.dev/perfection/">tanmay.bearblog.dev</a><br><br>
</div><pre>There is this thing about perfectionism: it promises you excellence but delivers paralysis. It tells you that nothing is worth striving for unless it's utterly flawless, that every moment must be optimised as much as possible, that every experience must be Instagrammable. But today was something different.</pre><div><br></div><pre>We live in a world obsessed with hyper-perfection, of curated feeds that show only the highlight reel, images filtered beyond recognition, lives that appear aesthetic yet effortless. Every image is morphed from reality, every moment is glorified for attention, every flaw is hidden like it never existed. We seem to have turned into performance artists of our own lives, constantly measuring ourselves against impossible standards that don't exist. We've commercialised authenticity itself, turning "realness" into another brand to perfect and polish. The irony just laughs in a corner.</pre><div><br></div><pre>But we should also take a moment to pause in our busy lives and embrace this strange, beautiful, messy experience of being human while we're here. The perfect moment will never come. The perfect plan will never be ready. The perfect words will never be written. But this moment, this precious, unrepeatable, imperfect moment, it is happening right now and now only.</pre>
