        <h1>Lifelong grind mode</h1>
  
  <div>What do you think about those who work extra hard all their lives? Sure, they contribute a lot to their community and their profession, and I bet they genuinely love their jobs. But I feel sorry for their spouses and kids. Do they get enough time with them? Being busy for a year or two is understandable, but what’s the point of all your success if you’re minimally available for your family? Of course, you’ve probably heard from them multiple times that they are okay with the arrangement. But are they really? Ask yourself.<br><br>
</div><div>The problem with burnout is that you often don’t realize it's happening. If you were aware, you would take steps to prevent it. An occasional break is simply not enough.</div><div><br></div><div>Do you truly love your job, or do you keep saying that because you’re invested in the image you’ve created? </div><div><br></div><div>A few days after you retire or quit, everyone at work will move on with your replacement as if nothing has changed. Don’t be delusional; we are all replaceable.</div><div><br></div><div>Go home and kiss your closest ones every evening. <br><br><figure>
