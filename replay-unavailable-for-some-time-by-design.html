</figure><br>I have seen this trend with streaming services. If you miss an event live they would not show the on demand replay version for several hours later. Or may even make you wait for a day or so. I do not think there is a technical limitation to showing the version right away. They are just doing this so that subscribers of cable have a superior experience over streamers. This is a limitation by design. <br>The strategy and accounting guys make this decision and that is really s----y of them to do so. </div>
