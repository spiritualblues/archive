        <h1>Trump's Expanded Domestic Military Use Should Worry Us All | ACLU</h1>
  
  <div>ACLU has an excellent write up on how and why the military and the executive branch should ALWAYS be separate from each other. And why the military should never be policing civilians. Basic civic education concept that we take for granted in a free democracy. And barely touch in schools. <br><figure>

However, you can still contribute to support their work if you strongly believe in their cause. <br><br>It's important to highlight that while protesting and vocal advocacy may not lead to significant change, litigation through the judiciary can have a meaningful, measurable impact. Additionally, the knowledge that the ACLU may challenge actions in court can serve as a deterrent for future misconduct.</div>
