But remember history and data is not on your side. Twenty years from now the ones invested in the SP 500 ETF for the long term are going to outperform you. Just because an ETF exists doesn't mean there are situations where it might be a right choice for you. It may be a bad choice for everyone of you. Just don't. They make ETFs to get rich from the fees they charge you. They do not care for what is right for you. Or if they will do better than SP 500 over the long run. They are just selling hope. And often when they tout recent outperformance it may be that the sector is just riding the wave. So post covid all genetics stocks did well for a while. Of course ARKG outperformed with that. But when the hype died the ETF is 20 percent of its peak and shows no sign of recovery. </div>
