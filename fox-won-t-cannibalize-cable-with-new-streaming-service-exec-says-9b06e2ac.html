</div><pre>From a pricing standpoint, we’re going to respect the wholesale arrangements we have with the current distributors,” Nallen said. “So, you won’t see us competing from a pricing standpoint with the traditional distributors. From a content standpoint, there will be nothing exclusive on it — so, whatever the traditional distributors are offering their consumers, we’ll be offering the cordless community, which is where we’re pointed to on this DTC (direct-to-consumer) service.”</pre><div><br></div><pre>“The worst thing we could do is take a consumer from the traditional side of any of our big partners and move them out and bring them into D2C,” Nallen said on Monday. “So our target market — and, therefore, our aspirations for the size of the platform to us from a subscriber standpoint — are pretty modest.”</pre>
