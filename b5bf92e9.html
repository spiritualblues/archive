  <div>I spent the evening sharing my love for ‘hey you’ by Pink Floyd with my 9-year-old, trying to show him why it's one of the greatest songs ever. He seemed a bit unimpressed, and I can't help but feel a little worried about his generation.<br><a href="https://youtu.be/soL8JK6kALc?si=c1oYZv__bQeQDgSk">https://youtu.be/soL8JK6kALc?si=c1oYZv__bQeQDgSk</a><br><br>Full lyrics <a href="https://www.azlyrics.com/lyrics/pinkfloyd/heyyou.html">here</a>
</div><pre>Hey, you!
Standing in the aisles
With itchy feet and fading smiles
Can you feel me?

Hey, you!
Don't help them to bury the light
Don't give in without a fight</pre><div><br></div><pre>Roger Waters said about this song in an interview for Mojo magazine in December 2009, <em>"It's about the break-up of my first marriage, all that misery and pain... It's a complete disaster, especially if you're someone like I was... Hopeless, really, I could do nothing but go fetal and weep."</em></pre>
