  <div>Its unfair when conservatives claim that liberals are any less patriotic than them when they try and not support every expression of national pride. Like taking the knee during the national anthem. I would classify that as one of the most peaceful forms of protest. With an effective message of dissatisfaction. They are not betraying their nation by just being skeptical or objecting. I can see this from a third person lens because I see this playing our in multiple nations that I follow politics in. And in some situations I may agree with the right and in some I may agree with the left. So this gives me a unique perspective and understanding. </div><div><br></div><div>
