        <h1>The sum of all streaming services is still less expensive  than cable</h1>
  
  <div>List of streaming services I am suscribed to - </div><ul>
<li>Netflix </li>
<li>Disney + premium</li>
<li>Paramount - comes with Walmart +</li>
<li>Max w ads</li>
<li>Hulu</li>
<li>CNBC +</li>
<li>Prime</li>
<li>YouTube premium.</li>
</ul><div>
<br>Now before you jump in and say - hey this costs just as much as cable - listen up - </div><ul>
<li>Contract - I am not locked in for a whole year or two </li>
<li>Hidden fees - I am not paying for their boxes under each TV (about $10 per TV)</li>
<li>No broadcast fee ($22 dollars)</li>
<li>Bundling - I am free to cancel anyone of these streaming services whenever I want. Just because I want to continue to watch soccer, I do not have to keep paying for Netflix</li>
<li>Not bundled with your expensive cable - You are not guaranteed to get all your niche content if you pay for cable. Champions league ⚽ is on Paramount. Some EPL ⚽games are on Peacock only. TNF 🏈 is on Prime. Cricket 🏏needs Willow TV. UFC 🥊needs ESPN+. You would need premium add-on for HBO content with your cable. A lot of newer Star Wars content would be on Disney + exclusively. </li>
</ul>
