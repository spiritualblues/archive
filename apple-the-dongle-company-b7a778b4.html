        <h1>Apple - the dongle company </h1>
  
  <div>The charging cable chaos at home - phew. It’s like a treasure hunt trying to find the right wire for each device, and then, just when you think you’ve cracked the code, there’s the challenge of matching it with the perfect power adapter on the other end. I’m optimistic that as time goes on, we’ll have all our gadgets upgraded and need USB-C on both ends of the cord, paving the way for a seamless charging experience – just in time to be beaten by the next USB technology! </div><div><br></div><div>Here is a list of all that I have - </div><div><br></div><ul>
<li>USB A to lightning - still have legacy power adaptors, so these are still in use. </li>
<li>USB C to lightning - for kids ipads. </li>
<li>USB C to Apple Watch magnetic charger </li>
<li>USB-C to MagSafe 3 Cable for mac air</li>
<li>USB A to micro usb - other non apple devices</li>
<li>USB A to 30 point dot connector - 😆  no devices in use, but my wife’s car has one of these. </li>
<li>USB A to C adaptor so that one of the legacy adaptors would work with newer cables. </li>
<li>USB C to an adaptor if I am using a new adaptor with an older cable. </li>
<li>Power adaptor USB A - legacy adaptors </li>
<li>Power adaptor USB C - Eventually, I'm hoping to move all to these. </li>
<li>USB-C Power 65 W Adapter for Mac air</li>
<li>HDMI to HDMI</li>
<li>USB C to HDMI since my Mac mini does not have a second HDMI out for my second display. </li>
