  <div>I have been wanting to understand the meaning behind this specific line from Drake's <a href="https://youtu.be/8ekJMC8OtGU?si=pGv3KYefNbHRKibY">recent song</a>. My initial guess would have been this was a much more NSFW reference with a deeper meaning. </div><pre>In the lyric "I'ma ice both of y'all like Gretzky," Drake is using a metaphor to describe lavishly gifting or "icing" both women with expensive jewelry or gifts, comparing it to the iconic hockey player Wayne Gretzky. Gretzky's name is synonymous with hockey excellence and dominance, so Drake uses it to suggest he will treat them like royalty, giving them gifts that reflect his own success and status.</pre><div>Courtesy google AI. </div>
