<br>I'm trying to decide between two options. The first one has a touchscreen and better reviews, but it doesn't flip to 360 degrees like its smaller counterparts. It's more rugged, has less storage, looks ordinary, and lacks a numeric keypad (which works for me), allowing for more spacing between the keys I need.<br><br>The second option features an OLED screen, is not a touchscreen, and is more aesthetically pleasing. It's sleek, lighter, and has a classier appearance, as well as a longer battery life.<br><figure>
