  <div>I have been somewhat annoyed by this host named <a href="https://www.instagram.com/alexandracooper/?hl=en">Alex Cooper</a> on SiriusXM who keeps dropping the F bomb 💥 twice per sentence. Often it is uncalled for and seems to be a wannabe just trying too hard to sound cool. <br><br>Turns out she is a <a href="https://www.callherdaddy.com/">hit</a> 👊 with the younger generation and Sirius XM is <a href="https://people.com/alex-cooper-net-worth-call-her-daddy-11749352#:~:text=In%20June%202022%2C%20the%20Los,Network%20to%20the%20radio%20giant.">paying her $125 million</a>  🤷‍♂️ over 3 years to bring her clout (younger followers) over. They even renamed one of their popular channel to align with her brand. <br><br><a href="https://youtu.be/QbJ_yKx-8KI?si=8vNzhvzHstSdRcAz">https://youtu.be/QbJ_yKx-8KI?si=8vNzhvzHstSdRcAz</a>
