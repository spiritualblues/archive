        <h1>Rant time</h1>
  
  <div>We design all these quality metrics with noble intentions. If you want to reduce safety incidents from 20 percent to 10 percent, metrics help drive positive change and, in turn, help the greater cause of keeping your employees safe. <br><br>You have already won when you bring the incidents down to 2 events per year. I am not talking about serious injuries or bad events. Let's exclude these. But next year, if you preach incremental improvement and say our goal is now zero, that's where I feel, unfortunately, people start gamifying the system. To keep you happy. To save face. If your incidents are minimal, you should have been content and stopped. Ensure your employees keep riding in cruise control and move your focus to a different metric. </div>
