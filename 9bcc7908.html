  <div>I have been trying to diversity away from tech stocks for a while. So I would obviously look into other sectors like industrials or utilities. The best investments in those sectors are the ones that get their tech pivot right. <br><br>So do I stay away from them since they are more of a tech winner?  Or do I go for other ones that aren't relatively overvalued due to getting their tech strategy right? <br><br>Tech is no longer a sector. It is a process to execute your overall business strategy. Its how you have a competitive edge over others. </div>
