        <h1>Recycling ♻️ and landfills 🕳️ 🌳</h1>
  
  <div>I obsessively and compulsively recycle all dry trash as much I can. Soda cans, water bottles, cardboard and plastic bags are a low hanging fruit. Very little inconvenience other than sorting. I don’t know 🤷‍♂️ why everyone doesn't do this. Just bugs me. There is just so much trash that be diverted into making new bottles, cardboard and down cycled to rubber / road construction material etc. </div><div>We need to get kids to start this habit in school. And make recycling ♻️ cool 🆒 .</div>
