</div><div>HEY launched its calendar 📅 over a year ago. I love the fact that when you are on their day view you have an option to just show events stacked all together as a bird eye view with no empty space for unfilled events to scroll through. That way the whole day fits on your screen without needing to scroll much. </div><div><br></div><div>Somehow this is the first calendar where the day/week view is usable for me. </div><div><br></div><div>“Sometime this week being carried forwards” is a pragmatic approach that reassures us procrastination is realistic. </div><div><br></div><div>I dig the way the “maybe calendar” is in italics with a zebra striped background. Tells you the plan is tentative. “Perhaps if we place this event on that afternoon”.</div><div><br></div><div>Countdowns to big days, day titles or labels, rich text journals with images and file attachments are features that I didn't know I needed. </div>
