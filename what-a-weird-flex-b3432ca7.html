However, here is what the Wall Street Journal posted on LinkedIn, so I assume I can share it as public content. </div><pre>Paul and Emily Ross have a little over $2 million in their retirement accounts, and spending it down won’t require a dollar in taxes.

They have reached the highest level among the growing number of savers who favor Roth individual retirement accounts and 401(k)s—and they are more than happy to tell you about it.

Paul, 51, has talked to his four boys about the benefits of Roth accounts, and he has done the same as a guest speaker at a high-school economics class. He has handed extended family members starting out in their careers $1,000 Christmas checks earmarked to open Roth IRAs. He gives everyone an Excel spreadsheet showing how compounding interest works.

“I’m all in,” said Paul, who is chief financial officer at VideoAmp, an advertising software tech company in Los Angeles. “I consider myself a Roth evangelist.”

From teenagers to octogenarians, Americans like the Rosses are pouring money into Roth accounts, both contributing directly and using “backdoor” Roth and “mega-backdoor” Roth strategies that allow them to slip in even more.</pre>
