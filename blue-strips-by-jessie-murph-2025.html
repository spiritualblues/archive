        <h1>Blue Strips by Jessie Murph ‧ 2025</h1>
  
  <div>I had to <a href="https://www.distractify.com/p/what-does-blue-strips-mean?utm_source=perplexity">look up</a> on what exactly ‘blue strips’ is. It’s a obscure reference -</div><pre><em>According to </em><a href="https://holler.country/news/general/blue-strips-by-jessie-murph-lyrics-and-meaning/"><strong><em>Holler Country</em></strong></a><em>, the term is likely a slang reference to hundred-dollar bills — there is a blue 3-D security ribbon woven into the paper. This ribbon, when tilted, displays alternating "100s and Liberty Bells that move side to side and up and down,” per the outlet. In the song, Jessie sings about going to the strip club and throwing blue-stripped $100 bills at one of the dancers.</em></pre><div><a href="https://youtu.be/aFpfY-EZwFo?si=3QgFXmKC9SFCE40w">https://youtu.be/aFpfY-EZwFo?si=3QgFXmKC9SFCE40w</a></div><pre>Smoking cigarettes on balconies (hmm)
