</figure><br>We were just talking about <a href="https://spi.blue/skeuomorphism-f83d040f">skeuomorphism</a> and I noticed another example. All non tesla EV makers have a cheap ugly sticker in place of the front grill. Why not just do what Tesla does - keep it the same solid color as the body. We do not need the grill functionality. We do not need it to look like a grill. <br><figure>
