        <h1>For all the wrong reasons</h1>
  
  <div>I am 1000x more likely to get roasted and unintentionally or intentionally misquoted and misinterpreted online than go viral for whatever positive I say. Some of this is due to the keyboard warrior rage culture online. Anyways, I just end up withdrawing away from posting on social media. And I am ok with that. <br><br>That could be a reason I like writing here. I don't have to prove anything to anyone. No constraints. No audience I need to satisfy. I think I will grow better as a writer this way and get better at articulating my thoughts in a clear and a concise manner. This last part is a very underrated skill. </div>
