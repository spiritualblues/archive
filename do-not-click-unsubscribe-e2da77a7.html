  <div>I have had my lastname@gmail as my first ever email address which has been spammed into oblivion. I used to do a lot of ‘click to unsubscribe’ in the past until I learnt I shouldn’t.

Spam crooks send millions of emails every day, sometimes indiscriminately to randomly generated recipient addresses. They are often unaware of whether the accounts they write to really exist or whether messages are read there–until users click on the unsubscribe button. The scammers then receive a request to stop writing to the email address in question, whereupon, of course, they do exactly the opposite.</pre>
