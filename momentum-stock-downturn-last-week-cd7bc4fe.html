        <h1>Momentum stock downturn last week</h1>
  
  <div>Jim Cramer made the point that momentum stocks are a sector by themselves irrespective of what conventional industry they are in under SP500 / NASDAQ. When they go down, they go down together. You can have a part of your portfolio in them, but not too much. They were hit pretty hard on days like Thursday or Friday last week. <br><br>Sure, your portfolio sinks, but these days, it would mess with your confidence and temperament. He worries that many investors will withdraw completely from investing as a result. And that's bad for the retail investor revolution that we are in. </div>
