        <h1>Scope of practice as a physician</h1>
  
  <div>Don't let patients define your scope of practice—EVER. Only you should be the one doing that, based on your training, comfort level, past scope that you have abided by, and local standard of care. <br><br>Patients may have a say in whether they go home today or tomorrow, but only if you feel either option is reasonable. If you think with fair certainty they are not ready today, don't let them sway your decision by much. This is hard to say and sounds very vague. Here is my acid test: If you imagine you are going to have difficulty falling asleep if you think of this discharge at bedtime, that patient should not be going home. <br><br>Patients will talk you into doing outpatient IV antibiotics. Remember inpatient care is more about round the clock monitoring. And immediate access to medical care. <br><br>At times it is convenient for the patients to have the primary take out that cyst close to the knee but you as a primary have to know that this has to be seen by ortho. <br><br>They don't decide if you can manage type 1 diabetes on an insulin pump. Only YOU GET TO DECIDE.<br><br><figure>
