        <h1>Game 7, win or go home!</h1>
  
  <div>Probably the one of the most exciting star studded game this season. Currently on. Max.com is actually streaming this game flawlessly. No hiccoughs. Too bad they are losing NBA after this season. They just seem to have managed to get streaming right. <br><br>

They all have solid streaming platforms already. NBA league pass is still a mess. So I have Amazon prime swallows it and releases it as an add-on service. Fanduel Sports network will keep their coveted rights for regional games. </div>
