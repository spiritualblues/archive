Given the extensive data mining and personalized targeting these platforms employ, you’d think they would have a better grasp of our preferences by now. Yet, I find myself relentlessly bombarded by the same advertisement time and again. For instance, I continually endure the Apple Safari privacy ad during every commercial break on NBC Peacock. It’s an exhausting experience that leaves me yearning for a more refreshing variety.</div>
