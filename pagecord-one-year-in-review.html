        <h1>Pagecord – One Year In Review</h1>
  
  <div>I have <a href="https://spi.blue/minimalistic-blog-a2586b1d">researched</a> various blogging platforms extensively. I finally landed on <a href="http://pagecord.com/">Pagecord</a> a year ago, and I couldn't be happier! I have been a premium user right from the beginning. </div><div>

<a href="https://pagecord.com/faq">Pagecord</a> lets you effortlessly <a href="https://blog.pagecord.com/hello-world-5f5e111">post by email</a>. You don't have to worry about a slow, non-mobile-first, bloated interface and third party plugins that bog you down (I am <a href="https://wordpress.org/support/topic/wp-admin-extremely-slow-2/">looking at you</a>, WordPress). Writing naturally through your email composer should encourage you to write more often. A neat trick is using the Apple iOS Mail app's <a href="https://blog.pagecord.com/a-neat-trick-for-adding-link-previews-using-apple-mail-e1251d78">link preview</a> feature. </div><div>

</div><div>YouTube shared video links and Spotify songs are automatically embedded. The composer is feature-rich (has everything you need and most importantly nothing that you don't need). I understand <a href="https://olly.pagecord.com/">Olly</a> is working on a new, <a href="https://blog.pagecord.com/preparing-for-a-new-editing-experience">upgraded</a>  interface. </div><div><br></div><div>Quoted text looks gorgeous if you are obsessive like me, and want things precisely as you envision. </div><div>

</div><div>Posts can be displayed as a stream of complete entries one after the other (with nothing for your readers to click through to read further), <a href="https://blog.pagecord.com/introducing-a-new-card-layout-for-your-blog">cards</a> like those on Hey World, or a <a href="https://blog.pagecord.com/a-new-choice-of-home-page-layout-for-your-pagecord-blog-928c9ded">list</a> of posts if that is your preference. </div><div>

</div><div>Your blog looks great on mobile, and I love the endless scroll of posts, replacing the need to click on page 2. You can add a <a href="https://blog.pagecord.com/pagecord-now-supports-pages">static</a> ‘about’ page too if you desire. </div><div>

</div><div>Pagecord offers gorgeous <a href="https://blog.pagecord.com/customise-your-pagecord-blog-with-themes-c8aa8f9d">themes</a> to choose from, along with a stunning dark mode! I love the monospaced font with maximum content width.  </div><div><br></div><div>Olly takes feature <a href="https://blog.pagecord.com/pondering-future-ideas-bc4ae902">requests</a> and rolls out what makes sense promptly. For example, he rolled out <a href="https://blog.pagecord.com/specify-a-canonical-url-for-your-posts-aa4581e0">canonical</a> tags for posts overnight when I requested. </div><div>

</div><div>Additionally, I was excited that he rolled out <a href="https://blog.pagecord.com/categorise-your-pagecord-posts-using-tags">tags</a>, as my blog is full of spontaneous ramblings and lacks a niche.</div><div><br></div><div>Longevity of such platforms is another aspect you need to consider. If they shut down or if you change your mind in the future (it happens), there is an easy <a href="https://blog.pagecord.com/pagecord-to-go-now-you-can-export-your-pagecord-blog-f147fe65">export</a> feature to take your content elsewhere.</div><div>

<br>Please give the (more than generous) free version a <a href="https://pagecord.com/signups/new">spin</a>, and you will not be disappointed! </div><div><br></div><div>I started thinking I would do long-form, well-researched, infrequent, high-quality posts over quantity. But I end up doing much more spontaneous microblogging than I anticipated. And I have fun doing so! Psst.. It’s the ease of this service. </div><div>
<br>My annual renewal is coming up in a month, and you bet that I would continue being an avid supporter of this independent platform! </div>
