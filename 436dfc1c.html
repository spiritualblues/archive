  <div>Apple's pricing strategy is interesting. They offer their base models at lower than expected price point, which is often surprising. Currently, they are selling the latest Mac Mini and MacBook Air at a deep discount through Amazon. Considering the alternatives, this represents incredible value for money for a device that is future-proof. While newer models may still be faster, practically speaking, these devices can easily last for about eight years if you primarily use them for internet browsing and other basic computer tasks.<br><br><figure>

Once you’re locked into their ecosystem, it feels like they are counting on you to get sucked into their services. I ended up using their cloud storage because no other provider would save the live versions of my iPhone photos. While Google and OneDrive do offer live photo storage, I figured it was easier to just pay for iCloud instead. With time I do appreciate the seamless integration between their devices. <br><br><figure>
