        <h1>"You become what you tolerate"</h1>
  
  <div>Specific individual quotes have influenced my work ethic and daily drive, playing a role in my formative years as I grew personally and professionally.  <br>One of them is the title above. To my disappointment, I have never found the original quote or author I could 100 percent confidently credit for this one. There are several variations that I can discover quoted in articles, but strangely, none of them are, as I always recollected the quote as above. This is the most original-sounding version I have found. <br><br>
