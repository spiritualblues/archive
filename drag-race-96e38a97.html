        <h1>Drag race</h1>
  
  <div>There was a tragic incident in our town. Three high schoolers crashed into a tree while racing each other. One succumbed. Kids, <strong>drag races are always a bad idea</strong> and are way more dangerous than driving fast. You switch off your common sense to win, and that's when bad things happen. </div>
