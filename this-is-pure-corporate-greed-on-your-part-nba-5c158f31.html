        <h1>This is pure corporate greed 🏀 on your part NBA. </h1>
  
  <div>Typically, all <a href="https://www.nba.com/schedule?cal=all&amp;pd=false&amp;region=1&amp;season=Playoffs">playoff games</a> are broadcast on national networks like ESPN/ABC or TNT/TBS. However, <a href="https://www.nba.com/magic/">Orlando's</a> playoff game is on NBA TV, which is accessible like the other national channels. The catch is that if you are in Orlando, you must have a subscription to a regional sports channel (<a href="https://fanduelsportsnetwork.com/">FDSN</a>) to watch it. This situation is quite unusual for a playoff game.<br><br>
</div><div>I understand that most regular-season games are shown locally on <a href="https://fanduelsportsnetwork.com/">FDSN</a> and not available on national TV, which gives their enough exclusive content to broadcast. However, when a regular-season game is aired nationally on ESPN, I can still watch it without needing a subscription to local FDSN. Well the game is shown in both places then. </div><div>
<br>So, why isn’t tonight’s playoff game on NBA TV available to everyone?<br><br><figure>
